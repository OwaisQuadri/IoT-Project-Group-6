## Description 
An IoT application where user can check the current and past temperature and humidity values of the generators to make sure they are operating in a stable environment to ensure longevity and reliability of the generators. Multiple generators in different locations can be monitored from the same application endpoint.  

## Source Code
we have included our source code for the:
1. Front-End PHP/HTML/CSS code deployed using Digital Ocean onto www.thermocheck.xyz
2. Back-End Python Django API deployed on Heroku
3. Adruino code to send Temperature and Humidity data to the API after measuring from the sensor.
