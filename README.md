# IoT-Project-Group-6
Submission for Design and Analysis of IoT Group Project by Group 6: Owais Quadri, Raveenth Maheswaran, and Sabesan Sivakumar.
## Description 
An IoT application where user can check the current and past temperature and humidity values of the generators to make sure they are operating in a stable environment to ensure longevity and reliability of the generators. Multiple generators in different locations can be monitored from the same application endpoint.  
The Application can be accessed from www.thermocheck.xyz, and the API can be accessed from ros-temphumid.herokuapp.com. Each new generator that will be added must have a NodeMCU temperature sensor with the "Adruino Code" running with a new generator name, in order for a new Generator module to be populated onto the website and API.

## Source Code
we have included our source code for the:
1. Front-End PHP/HTML/CSS code deployed using Digital Ocean onto www.thermocheck.xyz
2. Back-End Python Django API deployed on Heroku
3. "Adruino Code" to send Temperature and Humidity data to the API after measuring from the sensor.
